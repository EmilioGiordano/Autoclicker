# Simple Auto Clicker (Python)

This is a simple Python script that simulates fast mouse clicks when you hold a key.

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Two Python libraries:
  - `keyboard`
  - `mouse`

To install the libraries, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install keyboard mouse
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Save the script as `autoclicker.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where the script is.
3. Run the script with:

```bash
python autoclicker.py
```

4. Hold the **`C`** key to start auto-clicking.
5. Press **`F1`** to stop the script.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Be careful using this in games or apps that don't allow automation.
- If you want to change the key go to the source code and change the 5th line, variable '__tecla_activacion__'
